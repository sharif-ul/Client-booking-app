# Client-booking-app
This is a project of an entertainment ticketing agency, precisely a client agency that offers customers to book tickets
for hotels, events and shows throughout the Europe. Currently, they are seeking to launch an online booking system, a new web-based information system that will enable customers to make online bookings via the Internet. Typically each production of their program is shown at various locations and times all over Europe. 
In this project I uswe HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP Mysql to make front-end and back-end (server side) program to manage the client/ coustomet interest.
